# Mixed-Initiative-PCG
A tool plugin for Unity that makes suggestions for choosing and placing prefabs based on pre-established rules.

Unity version: 2021.2.5f1

The repository includes the whole project, with rules already written in, but without some of the 3D models packages, because they were licensed only for the original work.

The packages used are (* = the packages that need to be acquired separately):
